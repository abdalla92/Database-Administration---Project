# Database Administration - Project

This project demonstrates how to set up, test, and optimize different data platforms. The platform includes various on-premises database servers like MySQL and PostgreSQL, an open-source tool such as Datasette, and cloud-based databases like IBM DB2.

## Scenario
For this project, I will assume the role of database administrator at a data analytics consulting company. I have been assigned to a project where you need to set up, test, and optimize the data platform.  The platform includes various on-premises database servers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and an open-source tool such as Datasette, as well as optional cloud-based databases like IBM DB2.  My job is to configure, tune, secure, backup and monitor those databases and keep them running at peak performance.

This is a three-part project.

## Part 1: 
I worked with PostgreSQL server and performed the User Management tasks and handled the backup of the databases.

## Part 2: 
I  worked with MySQL server and performed tasks like configuration check, recovery of data. You will use indexing to improve the database performance. Identified which storage engines are supported by the server and which table uses which storage engine. Optionally, I also automated backup tasks.

## Part 3:  
I worked with an open-source SQLite-based tool, Datasette, or optionally on a cloud instance of an IBM DB2 server, to perform tasks such as data restoration, index creation to enhance query performance, and creating views to simplify query writing.
